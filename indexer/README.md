# CS50 INDEXER
## Sanjana Raj (SanjanaRaj25)

## Known Bugs
Memory Error:
see my submission of crawler for more details: there's a memory leak of 1600 bytes caused by an issue in my hashtable module, but this doesn't seem to be something specific to indexer

## Usage

To build `indexer`, run `make` or `make indexer`

To build `indextest`, run `make indextest`

To test, run `make test`. 

To get a valgrind report, run `make valgrind`. 

To clean up, run `make clean`.
